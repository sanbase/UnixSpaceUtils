`--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 To execute the shell's command mark the necessary files with the symbols
 ~'*','>', or '<' `, then press ^11 and put down the command.

	   When printing command the following symbols are actual:
 ^23 ^22  motion in string    ^24 ^25  insert/delete symbol
 ^10  go to begin               ^29 ^10  go to end
 `         The command may be folowed with the symbols:
 ^13      start command and wait for the result
 ^29&     background running of the programm
 ^Delete       cancel the command

 `The names of marked files will be substituted in command. Whis this the
 names marked with ~'*' or '<' `will be substituted before the first symbol ~'|'`,
 and the names marked with ~'>' ` will be added to the end of command.

	 ScreenSHell remembers the previous commands.
	 You can call they using
 ^21   recall the previous command
 ^20   recall the next     command

`--------------------------------------------------------------------------

` Creation of files and directories:
 ^26  put down the name of new file
 ^27  put down the name of new directory

` To copy/move file(s) mark it(they) with ^'*', transfer (if necessary)
` to the destined directory and press
 ^26  to copy the files
 ^27  to move the files

` If the file you create/copy alredy ¥xists in the current directory
   ScreenSHell will propose to rename it. It is also possible
 ^28    overwrite the file
 ^Delete    cancel

` If the name of the file to be created is ended with the symbol ^28
` the old file with the same name will be deleted by default.

` You can copy both the files and the library modules!

======== ^S creen^SH ell _====== RENAMING OF FILES ==== ^S creen^SH ell _=========
`------------------------------------------------------------------------

` To rename the file or directory press symbol ^'=' and write new name.
` When writing the following symbols are actual:

 ^23 ^22  motion in string    ^24 ^25  insert/delete symbol
 ^10  go to begin               ^29 ^10  go to end


` Whis this the file name may be followed with:

 ^13  to rename the file
 ^28  before renaming delete the file with the same name
 ^Delete   cancel

============ ^S creen^SH ell _=EXECUTION of PROCESSES= ^S creen^SH ell _============
`--------------------------------------------------------------------------
`-Before starting executive file you may mark the input and the output
files with the symbols ~'<' and '>'` respectively, and the files-arguments with ~'*'`.
Then bring cursor to the name of the file to be executed and press:
    ^9   to start the process
    ^&       background running       ^@  debugging
`- As for the ~text file` execution means translation of the file, for the ~Makefile`
it means ~make`. If the process ~'name'` was started as background one, his output
is addressed into the file ~'name.O'`, and the ~'¨¬ï'` is shown in the list of the
executing processes at the top of screen.
When the process is finished ~ScreenSHell` shows its return code:
    ^+        succesfull
    ^number = return code
    ^number?  abnormal closing on sygnal 'number'
In order to 'kill' the background processes press '(' and mark this
processes with symbol ^'-', then press ^13 or ^28.
` This regime allows also
    ^'?'      ScreenSHell will show state of the running processes
    ^Delete   transferance to the standard regime
